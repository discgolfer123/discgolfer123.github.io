A quick profile put together for CIS 216, but one that I can come back to and edit in the future as needed.  This is for practice/educational purposes.

My name is Dylan Albrecht, and I am student at Whatcom Community College pursuing an Associate Degree in Computer Informational Systems.  This is a portfolio of some of the projects I'm completed as a part of this program.  In the future I hope to be able to edit this portfolio to include more projects that I've created, as well as implement some HTML.  However, for now I am limited to the projects I have saved in Google Drive.
